# Soviet-Rock-Songs
Crissy, Jack, Misha --
A project researching the identifiable political/national/Soviet character of rock songs from the late Soviet period (late 1960s-1991), with particular focus on the "dissident-ness" (or lack thereof!) of particular songs from different regions of the USSR.
